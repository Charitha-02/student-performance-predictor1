# Student Performance Prediction System

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student academic performance using machine learning techniques.  
The system helps in understanding how various factors such as gender, parental education, and test preparation affect student results.

## Project Overview

The Student Performance Prediction System uses historical student data to:
- Analyze academic patterns
- Predict student scores
- Provide insights for better academic planning

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and a user-friendly web interface.
